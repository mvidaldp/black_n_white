# lsl_in_unity
Simple Unity 2D project with changing background color and click audio playing using [LabStreamingLayer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer). This project is a very basic example meant for audio and video latency testing of EEG recordings in VR experiments using the LSL library for data streaming.

For the further latency analysis check out this repo: https://github.com/mvidaldp/lsl_latency_analysis
