# lsl_in_unity
Simple Unity 2D project with changing background color and click audio playing using [LabStreamingLayer](https://github.com/sccn/labstreaminglayer). This project is a very basic example meant for audio and video latency testing of EEG recordings in VR experiments using the LSL library for data streaming.

To customize the playing audio, the changing colors or the exposition or repetition times, as well as how the data is sent via LSL, modify the script: [Assets/Scripts/Controller.cs](https://github.com/mvidaldp/lsl_in_unity/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Controller.cs)
